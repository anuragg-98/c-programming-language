~RECURSION.

idea:-
(i) Devide the problem into smaller subn problems.
(ii) specify the base condition to stop the recursion.

types:- there are 4 types of recursion.
(i) Direct recursion
(ii)Indirect recursion
(iii)Tail recursion
(iv)Non-tail recursion

(i) Direct recursion:- function is called direct recursive if it calls the same function again.
(ii)Indirect recursion:-A function (letr say fun) is called recursive if it calls another functiom (let say fun2)and then fun2 calls fun directly or indirectly.
(iii)Tail recursion:-A recursive function is said to be tail recursive if the recursive call is the last thing done by the function. There is no need to keep record of the previous state.
(iv)Non-tail recursion:-A recursive function is said to be non- tail recursive if the recursive call is not the last thing done by the function.After returning back, there is some something left to evaluate.
